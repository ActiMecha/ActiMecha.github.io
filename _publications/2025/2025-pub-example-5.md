abstract: >-
  Kirigami metamaterials exhibit exceptional softness, lightness, and stretchability, positioning them as promising candidates in advanced material design. However, their mechanical analysis is challenged by flexibility-induced instabilities and the inadequacy of rigid-body assumptions. This review outlines key challenges including the need for flexible tensile models and high-curvature cut-edge designs. It highlights the limitations of reciprocal mechanics in describing nonlinear, multistable, and asymmetric deformations. Static nonreciprocity is introduced as a powerful concept to break time-reversal symmetry, offering a new framework to tackle complex kirigami behavior. The study sets the stage for innovations in soft robotics, deployable systems, and flexible electronics.
