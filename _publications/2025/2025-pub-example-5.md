abstract: >-
  Kirigami metamaterials, known for their softness, lightness, and stretchability, face challenges in mechanical modeling due to instability and the failure of rigid-body assumptions. This review highlights the need for flexible tensile models and high-curvature designs, and introduces static nonreciprocity as a promising framework to capture their nonlinear, multistable, and asymmetric behavior, paving the way for applications in soft robotics and flexible electronics.
