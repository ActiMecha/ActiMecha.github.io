abstract: >-
  Fatigue-resistant conductive hydrogel nerve conduits (PVA/PEDOT:PSS) combine topological alignment (>500 S/m conductivity), mechanical robustness (500 J/mÂ² fatigue threshold), and enhanced bioelectrical transmission for peripheral nerve regeneration, achieving 89% functional recovery in rat sciatic nerve models.
