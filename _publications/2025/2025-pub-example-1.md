abstract: >-
  Biodegradable power sources offer temporary energy solutions for implantable bioelectronics, with batteries, supercapacitors, and nanogenerators providing reliable energy through storage, harvesting, and transfer. Future research should focus on improving biocompatibility, energy density, and degradation control to expand their applications in bioelectronics.
