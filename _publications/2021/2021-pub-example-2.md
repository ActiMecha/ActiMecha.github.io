  This work investigates wrinkle propagation across flower-like grain boundaries in graphene through theoretical modeling and atomistic simulations. A defect shielding effect is revealed, showing how wrinkle behavior varies with GB curvature. The study provides insight into designing graphene-based nanomechanical devices.
