  This study explores the dimensional transformation behavior of serpentine-shaped single-layer graphene nanoribbons under tensile loading using atomistic simulations. A theoretical model is constructed to examine topological deformation, and paper-based laser scanning experiments are employed for analogy. The findings reveal a counterintuitive dimensional transition mechanism, with potential applications in thermally or electromagnetically tunable devices.
