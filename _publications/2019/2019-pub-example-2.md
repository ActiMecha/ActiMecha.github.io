  This study reveals how intrinsic edge warping of graphene nanoribbons enables directional molecular motion through theoretical analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. The findings demonstrate that fullerene motion prefers the +z-warping edge direction, providing inspiration for designing nanodevices based on curvature-induced actuation.
