  This study examines how strain-stiffening in biological tissues influences growth and remodeling, particularly in airways. Using a growing tubular structure with collagen-induced strain-stiffening, the research incorporates the nonlinear hyperelastic Gent model and initial stress symmetry theory. Results show that strain-stiffening delays growth instability at moderate strains and prevents it at low strains, maintaining stable epithelial tissue. These findings suggest that strain-stiffening can slow instability in biological growth and remodeling, with implications for clinical interventions in chronic inflammatory airway diseases.
