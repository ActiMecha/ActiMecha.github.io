  This paper develops a reliability-based lightweight optimization method for stratospheric airship envelopes, considering three failure modes—bending wrinkling, hoop tearing, and bending kink. The proposed design approach incorporates multidisciplinary analysis and shows how geometry and loading conditions affect failure mechanisms and structural efficiency.
