  This study investigates the self-assembly behaviors of graphene sheets induced by surface topological defects using atomistic simulations. A systematic simulation approach reveals four distinct dynamic modes—polygon nanoscroll, polygon nanotube, breathing oscillation, and damping vibration—each modulated by geometric design parameters. The work proposes a reverse design paradigm to achieve targeted nanostructures for applications such as drug delivery.
