abstract: >-
  This paper proposes and verifies an optimal design approach for rubble mound breakwaters by accounting for the interactions of multiple failure modes, including overtopping, armor instability, and crown wall sliding. The model integrates construction and repair costs, with an auxiliary coefficient to quantify the impact of each failure mode on overall reliability and cost.
