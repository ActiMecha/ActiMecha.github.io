short_bio: | 
  Welcome! I am Yafei Wang, Associate Research Fellow at SUSTech. I received my Ph.D. from HIT and completed my postdoctoral research at Fudan University.
  My research primarily focuses on solid mechanics, with particular interest in the adhesion and instability mechanics of slender structures, as well as the mathematical and physical modeling of biological tissues and soft active materials.
  <br>
  You can find a full list of my publications here.  
  Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any inquiries or are interested in potential collaborations.
